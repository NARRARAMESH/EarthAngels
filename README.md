Earth Angels is a social app for daily acts of kindness. It was built as my final project as a front-end engineering student at The Iron Yard.

The app encourages users to complete daily acts of kindness for others, for their local community, and for the planet holistically.

I invite you to join us and do your daily work as a guardian of the goodness in this world, as a protector of peace on this planet. It's time to rise up.
